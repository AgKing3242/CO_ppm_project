# IoT-based Environmental Monitoring System with Machine Learning Integration

Data Collection Phase:
The project began with the collection of environmental data using sensors interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller board. A DHT11 sensor was employed to measure temperature and humidity levels, while an MQ135 sensor was utilized to gauge Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentrations. The Arduino microcontroller facilitated real-time data acquisition, reading sensor values and transmitting them to an ESP01 WiFi module for further processing.
